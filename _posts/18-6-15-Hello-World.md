title: About
---

I am a data scientist working on projects that support community resiliance and validate human experiences. I believe that change moves at the speed of trust, and I endeavor to activate and strengthen trust among people using the tools of data science.

I do statistics and data science at [Mathematica Policy Research](https://www.mathematica-mpr.com/). At MPR I aggregate, describe, analyze, and sometimes simulate public health data. Outside of business hours, I work on projects related to police accountability, media manipulation by the alt-right, and digital privacy. 

Previously, I was an undergraduate at Macalester College where I received degrees in statistics and economics.
